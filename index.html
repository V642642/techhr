factor, chef Ranveer Brar is one of the most celebrated chefs in the country.

He has set up restaurants in India (including at a heritage hotel, Alila Fort Bishangarh) and
abroad and curated the menu of many more (including cruise kitchens aboard Royal Caribbean).
His popularity on television is matched by his tremendous fan following on social media as well.
Getting the basics right and revering the kitchen as an artist would his/her studio, are mantras
he lives by and propagates to others as well.
He also pioneered the first ever Twitter video show called Ranveer On The Road, covering new
destinations each season and exploring their cuisines and cultures. For someone who pro-
pounds the theory of cuisine being an extension of culture, he strongly upholds the belief of
travel making a good chef better.
During the 2020 lockdown, he pioneered new shows encouraging people to cook at home and
with minimal ingredients that went on to be immensely popular.

He also partnered with various organisations during the Covid crisis to run fundraisers, the ben-
eficiaries ranging from daily wagers to farmers; as also a #BringThemBack campaign in associa-
tion with NASVI to help re-instate Street Food Vendors back in business.
An avid photographer with a keen eye for details, his love of art flows into his food styling and
photographs as well.
With a bestseller in his kitty, a popular host and judge on television and an artist both in and out
of the kitchen, chef Brar calls himself a food-sufi on a constant culinary quest."

Almost 20 years since inception, Max Life Insurance ranks as India’s largest non-bank, private life insurance company and the fourth largest private life insurance company in terms of total market share.
Prior to his current role, Tripathy worked with Max Financial Services Ltd., the parent company of Max Life Insurance; GE; Genpact, and Tata Steel in multiple capacities in India and the UK. 
He is deeply passionate about people-centricity and customer-centricity and is a strong believer of “what we do every moment today influences our future.”
In a conversation with Forbes Advisor India, he spoke of why new sales shouldn’t determine how well a life insurance company is doing and the opportunities for life insurance that lie ahead for a country with 130-crore citizens."

 It was after working with industry giants like Deloitte and Sapient, and his close to heart 3-year stint with Teach For India (NGO) to understand the educational inequity that exists in India and around the world, that he finally let that entrepreneur on the loose and set out on a journey to disrupt the education space. 

Failure never left him and success never got to his head! His entrepreneurial venture, Unstop (formerly Dare2Compete) presently serves over 3 million+ users from 40,000 plus companies and colleges across domains.

                             data-description="Chitresh Sharma, CEO and Co-Founder, Refyne
 
Born and raised in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, Chitresh Sharma graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from Christ College, Bengaluru, in 2009. At the age of 19, Chitresh founded his first enterprise, an IT outsourcing and marketing company in Bengaluru.
 
The business witnessed rapid growth and put Chitresh on the map as a budding entrepreneur. However, after introspecting and being encouraged by his family to build a venture with wide-ranging social impact, in 2012, Chitresh decided to study overseas to explore new possibilities.
 
While pursuing a Master’s Degree in International Marketing at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Chitresh found himself surrounded by new-age business ideas and concepts. The combination inspired him to research his dissertation subject, which ultimately led to his next project.
 
In 2013, Chitresh co-founded Glasgow-based Swipii, a digital cashback reward platform for shoppers. During the subsequent seven years, he learned the importance of staying focussed on core goals and, more critically, work culture. He concluded that pursuing a sustainable growth trajectory centred around people strategy was the key to building a successful business.
 
In early 2020, Chitresh returned to India to revisit the idea proposed ten years ago – creating a business that would leave a positive social impact. Chitresh’s initial research revealed a stark lack of awareness about personal finance in India. The findings inspired him to combine this observation with his learnings about the benefits of Earned Wage Access (EWA) during his time in the UK, which led to the establishment of Refyne.
 
Chitresh noticed India’s fintech landscape broadly has two options – UPI and lending, a duopoly with rampant exploitative service prices.
 
India historically lacked a standard credit score system. Chitresh began investigating how this affects the unbanked and underbanked population, which are not the primary focus of premium banks and lenders. His research uncovered that the absence of formal education on personal finance, among other factors, has led to masses often falling prey to predatory loan sharks and payday lenders, exposing themselves to a quick but costly solution.
 
Chitresh, via Refyne, aims to empower companies and their employees and transform them into active promoters of financial resilience and independence. Chitresh envisioned building a company where team members have an aligned vision for popularising EWA and fostering a culture of collective growth.
 
When he’s not working, Chitresh enjoys spending time with his family and reading to sharpen his skills."

                             data-description="Aimed at creating a new approach to business travel that helps companies save on travel and expense management costs while creating a rewarding experience, Anish along with his co-founder Mayank created ITILITE in February 2017.
 
During his stint with Mckinsey as a consultant, at a time when the economy was not very prosperous, the cost-saving aspect emerged to be a priority for most companies. Anish observed that organisations spend at least one per cent of the revenue on travel, with some industries spending up to 5-7% at times. 
When many of his clients seemed to struggle with this issue constantly, he decided to join forces with Mayank and effectively deal with the woes of Business Travel management altogether. 

Anish has always been a believer in technology holding the potential to drive efficiency wherever the processes are simple. This combined with the idea of successfully being able to urge the employee to save for the company is a powerful concept. Thus, the idea of simpler and smarter business travel as a seamless experience started evolving, and ITILITE was born. 

An alumnus of IIT Kharagpur and IIM Lucknow, Anish comes with a wealth of experience spanning over thirteen years. During his time spent in Myntra, he got to understand how technology is deeply changing the world around us for the better. He has also helped several Fortune 500 companies create significant bottom-line impact and learnt how people & processes should be set up for global success
 
Anish is focused on delivering the best experience in expense filing, expense reimbursements and business travel by building the first smart and employee-friendly platform based on transparency; efficiency and impact."

With just two looms and nine artisans in 1978, his journey four decades later stands at Jaipur Rugs becoming a global social enterprise exporting to over 60 countries while providing sustainable livelihood to 40,000 artisans in 600 remote villages across five states in India, out of which 80% of them are women. Management guru, C.K. Prahalad featured his revolutionary business philosophy in his globally acclaimed book -The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid. Mr Chaudhary has also been termed as ‘father of modern social enterprises’ by Prof. Jagdish N. Sheth from Emory University, USA. Sheth said, “Jaipur Rugs has become a role model, that business can serve society and at the same time … can be a capitalistic institution”. In 2019, Raj Sisodia featured Jaipur Rugs and NK Chaudhary in his book, ‘The Healing Organization’ for ‘The Power of Innocence’. The book highly celebrated NK Chaudhary’s steps towards healing the customers and transforming the society with love. He has won awards including E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year Award, CNBC TV18 Emerging India Award, Social Impact Award conferred by former president Pranav Mukherjee among others. As a simple man, he is devoted to the Indian hand-knotted rug industry with an aim to position it rightly in the world and to empower its real owner and creator - the Indian weaver. His philosophy of totality, inclusion and for-profit solutions to society are widely discussed."
